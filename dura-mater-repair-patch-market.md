<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dura Mater Repair Patch Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable</li><li>Non-absorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Dura Mater Repair Patch market comprises two primary types: absorbable and non-absorbable patches. Absorbable patches are designed to be gradually absorbed by the body over time, eliminating the need for a second surgery and reducing long-term complications. In contrast, non-absorbable patches remain in the body indefinitely, providing permanent support for dura mater repair. Both types are used to manage dural defects, with their specific applications depending on the patient's needs, the extent of the repair, and the desired outcomes.</p></p>
