<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Exhaust Fans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Fans</li><li>Axial Fans</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The commercial exhaust fans market primarily consists of two types: centrifugal fans and axial fans. Centrifugal fans utilize a rotating impeller to increase air pressure and direct airflow, making them suitable for applications requiring high resistance to airflow. In contrast, axial fans move air parallel to the fan's axis, offering high airflow rates at low pressure, ideal for ventilating large spaces. Both types serve essential roles in improving air quality and ensuring efficient ventilation in commercial settings.</p></p>
