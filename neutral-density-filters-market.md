<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neutral-density Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Reflective Type</li><li>Reflective Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Neutral-density (ND) filters are categorized into two main types: non-reflective and reflective. Non-reflective ND filters absorb light without creating glare, making them ideal for photography and cinematography to control exposure while preserving color accuracy. Reflective ND filters, on the other hand, utilize reflective coatings to reduce light intensity, often providing better durability and resistance to scratches. Both types cater to different user preferences and applications, influencing market dynamics based on factors such as quality, cost, and intended use in various visual media.</p></p>
